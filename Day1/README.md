Make sure you remember `HTML` + `CSS` (at least the basics), I attached some slides that could be helpful ... also I recommend some youtube channels such as **Traversy Media** and **Net Ninja**.

Also make sure that you are able to understand the `JavaScript` syntax, and solve basic problems using `JavaScript`.
